a) Decision Variables: x1 and x2
Objective function: f = x1 + x2
Constraints:
	2*x1 + x2 <= 7
	-x1 + 2*x2 >= 0
	x1 + 2*x2 <= 8

b) Inside lines CD and CE

c) Point E (2.8, 1.4)

d) The solution would be in point C, S3 will enter the basis (line AD will be non-active) and S2 will leave the basis (line BD will become active).
