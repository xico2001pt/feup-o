i) The best production mix is 2000 model 101 and 1000 model 102
ii) The best production mix would be changed to 1999 of Model 101 and 1001 of Model 102. The increment of a machine-hour is worth a contribution increase of 2000€, which can also be seen in the Sensivity Report.
iii) If we change the value to 4100 machine-hours, we get a contribution increase of 200000€, which is 100 times the previous increase.
iv) According to the Sensivity Report, the Allowable Increase is 500. So, the number of units of engine assembly capacity that can be added before there is a change in the value of an additional of capacity is 501.

To determine whether TTC should purchase engines from an outside supplier, the company must compare the cost of renting capacity with the cost of increasing capacity internally.
So, we need to calculate the incremental contribution per machine-hour of capacity to determine the maximum rent it should be willing to pay for a machine-hour of engine assembly capacity.

According to the results on the excel file, the profit for Model 101 and Model 102 are 3000€ and 5000€.
The total hours for Model 101 and Model 102 production are 4h and 5h.
So, the incremental profit are 3000€/4h=750€/h and 5000€/5h=1000€/h, respectively.

Therefore, TTC should not rent capacity if the rental rate is greater than the incremental contribution.

The maximum number of machine-hours TTC should rent is determined by the amount of demand for each truck model and the metal stamping and models assembly.
